          <h2>To My Dearest, Kris</h2>
          <h3>Love is such a sweet, treasured thing, yet at the same time, it can be sad and tiring. You, however, have made it so beautiful.</h3>
          <p>I'm proud of you for waking up every day and making it through, whether the day is good or bad. I'm glad that you are here. No matter the distance or time that may separate us, it's not going to change anything about our love, and I'm proud of that. I'm proud of us for maintaining this relationship through thick and thin. I know that ever since the start of our long-distance relationship, things have been challenging for us, and I acknowledge that I've made mistakes during those difficult times. I apologize for everything, for being immature at moments and for not always knowing how to move on, I didn't thought how it affects also your mental health. I'm sorry for the times I made you feel like you are not doing enough but I promise you that you are more than enough, You have been trying your best and that's all what it matters to me. We can together forget the past to make our own future that's good for the both of us. You are literally the most perfect person I've ever met, and I will always think of you that way. I'm grateful that you are my first and hopefully my one and only. You deserve all the good things in your life after everything you've been through that you never deserved to experience. I'm willing to give you my all for you to have a better life and a brighter future. I will always be thankful for your presence, for every effort you've shown, and for everything, they really mean a lot to me. You mean more to me than you know, and I will always be by your side, no matter what happens. I care about you deeply and always want to care for you. I want to be the girlfriend you can be proud of, and the person you always feel comfortable with. I will love you in a way that's real and grow with you. Sometimes, I may not fully understand how you perceive yourself, but I hope you know that you are a good person inside and out. Please don't be too hard on yourself, you are more than what you think. Thank you for all the memories we've shared, for making me the happiest girlfriend just by being who you are. I can't wait to finally have the freedom to be with you, to finally appreciate you, holding your hand, kissing you, hugging you, posting you and everything else without even worrying about a thing. Life is gonna be so much better with you. I hope one day you'll finally also fall in love with life and living it, I don't ever want to lose a precious person like you are, You are all what I care for. I can't wait for the days I'll be seeing you in our own very home and our kids and our pets that's waiting for us in the future. Just thinking of the future already makes me happy. I look forward to creating more memories with you. Always and forever, I love you Kris.<br>
